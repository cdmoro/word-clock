# Word Oâ€™Clock



## Features

- Zen mode: remove all the distractions ([link](https://wordoclock.netlify.app/?zen=true))
- [Screensaver mode](#screensaver): make the quotes dance around the screen! ([link](https://wordoclock.netlify.app/?screensaver=true))
- Languages: supports English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, and Italian (by default, it will try to use the system language)
  - Random language: see a quote in a different language each minute, isn't that cool? ([link]([https://wordoclock.netlify.app/?locale=random](https://wordoclock.netlify.app/?random-locale=true)))
- [Themes](#themes): the clock has `colour themes` and `special themes` and each theme has light and dark variants, of course
  - Random colour theme: see a different colour theme each minute, isn't that even cooler? ([link](https://wordoclock.netlify.app/?theme=color-system))
- Fade effect
- Font personalization: if you don't like the default font of a theme, that's perfectly fine, we won't judge you, so you can change it for another using the `font` param!
- Responsive: no matter how long a quote is, it will always look good on desktop and mobile ðŸ˜Ž
- Static mode: get rid of all the javascript event listener an control the clock only with query parameters
- All the settings are saved in the browser's local storage and they are updated in the URL without refreshing the page, thanks to History API

## Screensaver

If you want to use this clock as a screensaver there are several ways to address this, although, it depends on the OS. I'm currently using the Mac OS solution and it worked like a charm. You can find more information here:

- Mac OS: Mac OS X Screen Saver powered by a Web View (https://github.com/liquidx/webviewscreensaver)
- Windows: Set Webpage as Screensaver in Windows 10 (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UovZwUlwwEs)
- Linux: Live Webpage as a Desktop Wallpaper on KDE Desktop (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_v1sJhBu25o)
